TODO: 

Textual document describing the data collection and cleaning process that has been performed, the
attempts made in terms of predictor variables and the reasoning behind them. The document must also
report the results achieved with the two different training strategies described above (only recent issues
vs all issues). Additional analyses looking into the results are welcome (e.g., Is it possible to improve its
usability by filtering only the recommendations having a high confidence?).
